# Beyond Originality

Hans-Georg Moeller's article, Beyond Originality: The Birth of Profilicity from the Spirit of Postmodernity, explores the shift from authenticity to profilicity as the dominant mode of identity formation. Authenticity, which emphasized self-discovery and originality, is now being replaced by profilicity, a process where identity is curated, displayed, and validated through public observation. Instead of striving to “become who you are,” profilicity encourages individuals to “become who you wish to be seen as.” This shift aligns with postmodern theories of identity, which emphasize performance, social construction, and the role of media in shaping reality​

.

Moeller situates profilicity within the broader intellectual history of postmodern thought, drawing from Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Derrida, and Baudrillard. Nietzsche, while often cited as a champion of authenticity, also deconstructed the notion of a fixed, original self. Wittgenstein, in his later work, argued that meaning in language is not inherent but emerges through social usage and play, an idea that parallels how identity is shaped in profilicity. Derrida’s concept of différance and his critique of the "metaphysics of presence" further undermined the idea that identity is rooted in an essential truth, while Baudrillard’s theory of hyperreality described how signs and simulations replace any supposed original reality​

.

A key distinction Moeller highlights is between first-order and second-order observation. Authenticity operates on first-order observation, where individuals recognize themselves and others as original selves. Profilicity, however, is built on second-order observation, meaning individuals construct their identities by monitoring how they are perceived by the public. This aligns with social media culture, where identity is shaped by curated profiles and public validation rather than inner self-discovery. Profilicity is thus deeply connected to branding, as brands, like personal profiles, do not derive meaning from an intrinsic essence but from how they are socially perceived​

.

While some might see profilicity as inauthentic or superficial, Moeller does not dismiss it as inherently negative. He argues that authenticity itself was paradoxical—the pursuit of originality became formulaic, as individuals sought authenticity by imitating others. Additionally, authenticity was often marketed as a consumer ideal, further undermining its premise. In contrast, profilicity is simply a more fitting identity technology for a media-saturated world, where recognition and meaning arise through public engagement rather than private self-reflection​

.

Ultimately, Moeller presents profilicity as a consequence of postmodernity, rather than a deviation from a more "genuine" past. In a world where brands, influencers, and social media platforms dominate identity construction, the ability to curate and maintain a profile has become essential. While profilicity has potential downsides, such as dependence on external validation and the risk of identity crises, it is neither better nor worse than authenticity—just different. Rather than lamenting its rise, Moeller suggests we understand profilicity on its own terms, acknowledging its performative nature and the evolving ways identity is shaped in the digital age​

# A different Perspective

The transition from sincerity to authenticity, and now to profilicity, is part of a broader intellectual discussion on identity formation in social and philosophical thought. Sincerity, as described by Lionel Trilling in Sincerity and Authenticity (1972), was historically tied to conforming to societal roles and being honest within a fixed social structure. In pre-modern societies, identity was largely shaped by external obligations—people were expected to behave in ways that aligned with their social roles rather than expressing a unique inner self. This mode of identity formation relied on first-order observation, where individuals saw themselves as reflections of their assigned social positions. However, the rise of individualism in modernity challenged this framework, leading to the emergence of authenticity as the dominant paradigm​

.

Authenticity, as analyzed by Charles Taylor in The Ethics of Authenticity (1991), was deeply connected to the idea of self-discovery and personal truth. Thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and existentialists such as Heidegger and Sartre championed the notion that true identity comes from looking inward rather than conforming to societal expectations. The imperative “Become who you are,” famously echoed by Nietzsche, captures this shift toward self-actualization and originality. Yet, as Moeller notes, authenticity itself became paradoxical—if everyone is pursuing uniqueness in the same way, then originality becomes a mere performance. This aligns with critiques by thinkers like Adorno, who saw authenticity as becoming a marketable aesthetic rather than a genuine mode of being​

.

Scholars of originality, such as Harold Bloom in The Anxiety of Influence (1973), have explored how the very pursuit of originality often leads to imitation. Bloom’s work in literary theory demonstrates how even great writers struggle with the inescapability of influence, undermining the idea that originality is a purely independent achievement. This applies to identity as well—if individuals construct their "true selves" by borrowing from cultural templates, then authenticity is always socially mediated rather than purely personal. Moeller’s notion of profilicity builds upon these critiques by highlighting how identity today is shaped by the validation of public audiences, making self-expression a second-order process rather than a private discovery​

.

Another related discussion comes from sociologist Erving Goffman, whose work in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1956) describes identity as a performative act rather than a fixed essence. Goffman’s dramaturgical approach argues that individuals are constantly curating their identities for different social contexts, much like actors on a stage. This idea foreshadows profilicity, where individuals construct their profiles for public recognition rather than self-validation. While authenticity sought an “inner truth,” profilicity recognizes that identity is always mediated through social perception. This resonates with Moeller’s claim that identity today is not about being true to oneself, but about crafting a coherent and appealing public image​

.

Finally, contemporary discussions on social media and digital identity further contextualize Moeller’s theory. Scholars such as Sherry Turkle (Alone Together, 2011) and Zygmunt Bauman (Liquid Modernity, 2000) have analyzed how digital platforms encourage a fluid, curated self-presentation, where validation comes from likes, comments, and follower counts. Social media intensifies the shift from authenticity to profilicity, as identity becomes increasingly shaped by algorithmic feedback rather than inner conviction. This aligns with Baudrillard’s concept of hyperreality, where signs and representations take precedence over any underlying reality. In this sense, profilicity is not merely a product of social media but an extension of postmodern identity construction, where individuals craft identities as brands within a network of public validation​

That's all folks!!!!!!!!!!!!!
