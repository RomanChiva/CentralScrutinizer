# Personality Crisis!: Identity Technologies in the 21st Century

## Beyond Originality

Hans-Georg Moeller's article, *Beyond Originality: The Birth of Profilicity from the Spirit of Postmodernity*, explores the shift from **authenticity** to **profilicity** as the dominant mode of identity formation. 

- **Authenticity** emphasized self-discovery and originality.  
- **Profilicity** is about curating, displaying, and validating identity through public observation.  

Rather than striving to *“become who you are,”* profilicity encourages individuals to *“become who you wish to be seen as.”* This aligns with postmodern theories of identity, emphasizing **performance, social construction, and media influence** in shaping reality.

### Intellectual Foundations of Profilicity

Moeller situates profilicity within **postmodern thought**, drawing from:

- **Friedrich Nietzsche** – Deconstructed the notion of a fixed, original self.  
- **Ludwig Wittgenstein** – Argued meaning in language arises through social usage, paralleling identity construction in profilicity.  
- **Jacques Derrida** – His concept of *différance* challenges the idea of an essential truth behind identity.  
- **Jean Baudrillard** – Described *hyperreality*, where signs and simulations replace any supposed original reality.  

### First-Order vs. Second-Order Observation

Moeller makes a key distinction between:

- **First-Order Observation** – Identity is recognized as an original self (*authenticity*).  
- **Second-Order Observation** – Identity is constructed based on how others perceive it (*profilicity*).  

This aligns with **social media culture**, where identity is shaped by curated profiles, public validation, and branding, rather than inner self-discovery.

> *"Identity is no longer about self-exploration but about managing a public image."*  

### Is Profilicity Superficial?

While some criticize profilicity as inauthentic, Moeller argues that:

- **Authenticity itself was paradoxical** – The pursuit of uniqueness became formulaic and commercialized.  
- **Profilicity fits the media-driven world** – Identity today is shaped through public engagement, not private reflection.  

Ultimately, **profilicity is not inherently better or worse than authenticity—just different.** In a world of influencers, brands, and digital personas, curating and maintaining a profile has become essential.

## A Different Perspective

The transition from **sincerity** → **authenticity** → **profilicity** follows a broader intellectual evolution in identity formation.

### The Age of Sincerity

Historically, identity was shaped by **social roles and obligations**:

- **Sincerity** (as discussed by Lionel Trilling) meant adhering to societal expectations.  
- Identity was a reflection of one's assigned position rather than an individual choice.  

### The Rise of Authenticity

With **modernity**, individualism challenged traditional social roles:

- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Heidegger, and Sartre** emphasized self-discovery.  
- Nietzsche’s *“Become who you are”* captured this shift.  

However, **authenticity became performative**—if everyone seeks uniqueness in the same way, is it truly original?  

**Harold Bloom’s** *The Anxiety of Influence* shows how originality often leads to imitation, undermining the idea that identity is purely personal.

### Identity as Performance

Sociologist **Erving Goffman** argued in *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life* that:

- Identity is a **performance**, adapted for different social contexts.  
- Profilicity extends this, making **public perception the primary source of validation**.  

Rather than seeking an inner truth, identity today is about crafting a coherent and appealing **public image**.

### Digital Identity & Postmodernism

Contemporary thinkers like **Sherry Turkle** (*Alone Together*) and **Zygmunt Bauman** (*Liquid Modernity*) highlight how:

- **Social media intensifies profilicity** – Identity is shaped by algorithms and feedback loops.  
- **Baudrillard’s hyperreality** – Representations and curated personas replace "authentic" identity.  

Profilicity isn’t just a result of social media—it’s a continuation of **postmodern identity construction**, where individuals craft their selves as **brands** in a network of public validation.

## Conclusion

Profilicity is not a **loss of identity**, but an adaptation to a media-saturated world.  

Rather than lament its rise, Moeller suggests we:

1. **Understand profilicity on its own terms.**  
2. **Recognize its performative nature.**  
3. **Acknowledge the evolving ways identity is shaped in the digital age.**  

> *"Identity has always been a social construct—today, it’s just more obvious."*
